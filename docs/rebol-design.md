# REBOL Design Principles in RebelDB

## Introduction

RebelDB is inspired by [REBOL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rebol) (Relative Expression-Based Object Language), a powerful and flexible programming language designed by Carl Sassenrath. This document outlines the key REBOL design principles that inform RebelDB's architecture and explains how these concepts are applied in our implementation.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Simple, Lightweight Value Types

REBOL's power comes from its simple but expressive core value types that can represent a wide variety of data:

- **None**: Represents absence of a value
- **Integer**: Whole numbers
- **String**: Text values
- **Block**: Ordered collections of values (similar to arrays or lists)
- **Word/SetWord**: Symbolic references and assignments
- **Context**: Key-value pairs for attribute-value associations

These types provide a foundation for expressing complex data structures while keeping the core language simple. In RebelDB, we implement these as variants in the `Value` enum, providing a consistent interface for all data representation.

### 2. Context as a First-Class Concept

In REBOL, contexts (similar to objects or dictionaries in other languages) are fundamental. A context is essentially a collection of words bound to values. This makes it easy to:

- Create namespaces
- Implement object-like structures
- Define configurations
- Build domain-specific languages

In RebelDB, we implement contexts as `Value::Context` with efficient key-value storage using SmolStr for keys to optimize memory usage while keeping fast access patterns.

### 3. Homoiconicity

REBOL code is also REBOL data, meaning code and data share the same structure. This design enables:

- Code that writes code
- Simple metaprogramming
- Powerful DSL creation
- Concise syntax

In RebelDB, both code and data are represented by the same `Value` structures, allowing seamless transitions between data and executable code.

### 4. Symbolic Computation

Words in REBOL are symbolic references that can be manipulated and evaluated. This enables:

- Dynamic binding of names to values
- Late binding for flexibility
- Self-modifying code patterns

In our implementation, we use `Value::Word` and `Value::SetWord` to represent these symbolic references.

### 5. Unified Data Exchange

REBOL was designed for data exchange across systems, which we extend in RebelDB through:

- Binary serialization for compact storage
- Consistent serialization for all value types
- Powerful parsing capabilities

The `serialize.rs` module implements this vision with efficient binary encoding and the Visitor pattern for extensibility.

## Value Representation

### Value Semantics

RebelDB's value system is designed primarily for data exchange rather than computation. This means:

1. Values are immutable once created
2. Context lookups are optimized for reading over writing
3. Values can be efficiently serialized and deserialized

### Context Implementation

Contexts in RebelDB are implemented as `Box<[(SmolStr, Value)]>` which provides:

- Memory efficiency with small string optimization
- Fixed memory overhead for small contexts
- Predictable serialization format

Unlike some REBOL implementations which optimize for fast property access via hash tables, our implementation prioritizes serialization, memory efficiency, and simplicity.

## Serialization

The `serialize.rs` module implements a visitor-based serialization pattern that:

1. Abstracts serialization format from value representation
2. Uses efficient binary encoding with variable-length integers
3. Supports nested structures to arbitrary depth
4. Provides robust error handling during both serialization and deserialization

## Future Directions

As RebelDB evolves, we plan to extend these REBOL-inspired principles with:

- Additional value types (Date, Time, URL, etc.)
- More serialization formats (JSON, MessagePack)
- Dialect capabilities for domain-specific languages
- Improved parsing for flexible syntax
